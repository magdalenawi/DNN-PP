# DNN-PP
========

This repository contains the implementation of the model proposed in `DNN-PP: A Novel Deep Neural Network Approach and its Applicability in Drug-related Property Prediction` for molecular properties prediction.

This is a PyTorch implementation.
This code is still work in progress and is intended for research purposes.

## Dependencies

Compatible with PyTorch 1.5 and Python 3.7.

## Usage

### Datasets
Six benchmark datasets (http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1) are utilized in this work.

### Training
Open the folder "core".
In order to train and test the model, you can use:

    python train_and_test.py

## Acknowledgments

The paper is under review.
